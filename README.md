Please help us complete a mental model study concerning the understanding of java concurrent programming. Many people feel that concurrent programming is hard, and we want to understand why it is so difficult. The study is designed by a graduate student in the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick.  

The study will last half an hour or less. By contributing to our study, you can get an e-gift card if you finish this experiment in one sitting. There are no other obligations for this study, and you can choose to start your study any time at your convenience.  

----------------------------------------

People with experience in Java **(especially Java Threads)** are needed. 

We want:  

- College Students

- College Professors

- Professional Programemrs

- Other people wirh related background

----------------------------------------

Note:  

1.	Please use a newer version of web browser, older browsers may not support the code module. 

2.	All participants must be over 19 years old.  

3.	If you meet these qualifications, click on this link to participate in our study https://run.pavlovia.org/pentagon_ma/concurrentmental_ver6/html. The experiment is required to be finished in one continuous sitting.  

4.	E-gift cards will be given to you later in December (maybe earlier). We will not disclose any information at any time.  

For more information, you can send an email to Zhangliang Ma, zma7@unb.ca
